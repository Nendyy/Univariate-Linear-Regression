# Univariate-Linear-Regression
This repository contains code for performing linear regression optimization using gradient descent and visualizing the cost function surface.

## Objectives

. Implement the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch

. Perform univariate linear regression with Numpy and Python

. Create data visualisations and plots using matplotlib

. Use linear regression to predict profits in each city for a bike company

> The code provided includes several functions and snippets to perform linear regression optimization using gradient descent and visualize the cost function surface. It allows you to find the optimal parameters for a linear regression model and understand how the cost function changes with different parameter values.
